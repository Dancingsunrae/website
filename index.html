  <p>One day I will live in a beautiful van, with a beautiful man, and our two magnificent beasts.
    Or at least one magnificent beast, my pup Roshi. But my beautiful man is welcome to have a dog too.
    Easier to raise two kids instead of one, I always say (having never raised any human ones).
    We will travel from coast to coast in this van, swimming, surfing, soaking in the sun. We will traverse
    through mountain passes and find little villages that flourish with kindness and old habits, and
    not being in a hurry. We will learn to slow down and drink the medicine of the stars and open skies.
    I will write, stories and code, of shamanic realms and sojourns, and the androids that can be our friends,
    if we are careful to not allow the human beans to spoil them. </p>
